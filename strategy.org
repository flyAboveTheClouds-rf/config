* Attack Strategies
** Ask Interesting Questions
*** What Phrase or Idea does this statement represent?
*** Create WordLists
**** Search the code-base for interesting words
*** What are the most interesting/boring parts of a code-base?
**** Databases?
**** Configuration?
*** Why don't you remove pieces of code and run the program - See what happens?
*** What files does the code-base write to disk?
*** Can the code get online?
**** Observe the behaviour of the program to understand the code behind it
**** Like causing except statement errors in the program does what the code says it does
*** What if i listed all the comments of a code-base in a file so I can pick the interesting parts of the code?
*** Hey! list all the file-extensions of a code-base
*** What are the phrasal files?
*** What cool feature can I add to this program?
*** What is this program built around? / What's its essence?
*** What constants of this program can I change so I can modify its behaviour?
*** Does this program have a Configuration file?
*** How did the developer implement certain features?
**** How'd she do it?
*** How does the real world code work?
*** Look for system-calls?
** Use Tools
*** You can search comment indicators like '#' '//' to quickly look if there are comments in the code-base
*** Search Documentation from your editor
**** Identify key-words from docs to search the code-base
*** A Tool to identify phrasals
*** A STANDARD to facilitate 'reading code'
** Read Phrasally
*** You should have a list/tree of all phrasal concepts
*** A Summary of the Code?
*** A Map[s] of the Code?
** What you shouldn't do
*** Don't start reading the code without asking Questions
*** It must be a puzzle
** Notes
*** We want to see something familiar in the code to hang on, to crawl in
*** If you see too many things you don't understand - it's a turnoff
*** Maybe your tool should automatically search for familiar code
*** Not just familiar code - holistic code - code that I can understand what it's doing
*** So all you should do is find a familiar & grok-kable piece of code
*** Your starting-piece-of-code should be meaningful, small
